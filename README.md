# THTSim
THTSim is a deterministic agent based simulation intended to model societies based on geographic determinism.
THT stands for Topography, Humidity, Temperature, the three geographic determiners in the simulation aside from the effects of neigboring cells.
The simulation works by having distinct cultures at the start that grow in population and spread to adjacent tiles. Cultures then clash with one another as well as develop technology based on their geography. 

The exact rules of the simulation are to follow when they have been fully determined.
